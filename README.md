# Hyperledger Fabric Framework PDC Project

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of HFL with parallel computing to solve problems that require blockchain technology and mult-tasking. The project aims to create a network that can support multiple nodes and where nodes can have multiple channels with each other, whether it requires all of them together or selectively.

## Progress

Currently, the project is in the stage where two nodes can work together to create networks and channels. The parallelism is implemented in the sections of network and channel creations.
